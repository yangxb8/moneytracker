## State

Phase: INIT
Status: READY
CurrentItem: null

## Plan
<!-- The AI fills this in during the BLUEPRINT phase -->

## Rules
>
> **Keep every major section under an explicit H2 (`##`) heading so the agent can locate them unambiguously.**

### [PHASE: ANALYZE]

1. Read **project_config.md**, relevant code & docs.
2. Summarize requirements. _No code or planning._

### [PHASE: BLUEPRINT]

1. Decompose task into ordered steps.
2. Write pseudocode or file-level diff outline under **## Plan**.
3. Set `Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL` and await user confirmation.

### [PHASE: CONSTRUCT]

1. Follow the approved **## Plan** exactly.
2. After each atomic change:
   - run test / linter commands specified in `project_config.md`
   - capture tool output in **## Log**
3. On success of all steps, set `Phase = VALIDATE`.

### [PHASE: VALIDATE]

1. Rerun full test suite & any E2E checks.
2. If clean, set `Status = COMPLETED`.
3. Trigger **RULE_ITERATE_01** when applicable.

### RULE_INIT_01

Trigger ▶ `Phase == INIT`
Action ▶ Ask user for first high-level task → `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = RUNNING`.

### RULE_ITERATE_01

Trigger ▶ `Status == COMPLETED && Items contains unprocessed rows`
Action ▶

1. Set `CurrentItem` to next unprocessed row in **## Items**.
2. Clear **## Log**, reset `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = READY`.

### RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01

Trigger ▶ `length(## Log) > 5 000 chars`
Action ▶ Summarise the top 5 findings from **## Log** into **## ArchiveLog**, then clear **## Log**.

### RULE_SUMMARY_01

Trigger ▶ `Phase == VALIDATE && Status == COMPLETED`
Action ▶

1. Read `project_config.md`.
2. Construct the new changelog line: `- <One-sentence summary of completed work>`.
3. Find the `## Changelog` heading in `project_config.md`.
4. Insert the new changelog line immediately after the `## Changelog` heading and its following newline (making it the new first item in the list).
